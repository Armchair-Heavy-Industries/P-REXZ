# P-REXZ
The P-REXZ is a cantilevered CoreXZ 3D Printer with a polar bed. 

The current state of the project is as follows:
Mechanically, the printer is functional and prints. Currently a more capable klipper polar kinematic type is being worked on to fix issues related to the 0,0 singularity and also bed accelerations around the singularity.
