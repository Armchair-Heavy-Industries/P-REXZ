# P-REXZ
The P-REXZ is a cantilevered CoreXZ 3D Printer with a polar bed. 

The current state of the project is as follows:
Mechanically, the printer is functional and prints. Currently honing in printability and ease of assembly. A more capable Polar/PolarXZ kinematic type has been added to klipper, and optimization still needs to be done.
